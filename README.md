# p4-tutorials-vm

A pre-built virtual machine of p4 tutorials (at https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials).

For some reason you can't fix the installation progress and want a pre-built vm for the new tutorials' environment (ubuntu 20.04).

You can use either of the two files to install vm, given by links.

These files have been tested on Windows 10 with VirtualBox 6.1 and Vagrant 2.2.19.

## Build from OVA file (Recommended)

You may not need Vagrant, simply import this file in VirtualBox.

## Build from vagrant box

The installation instructions have been given in it.

You can also download it from Google Drive.

## note

I have changed the DNS server address and apt source address in order to adapt it to China's network environment, you may change /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/apt/sources.list to suit your network environment.
